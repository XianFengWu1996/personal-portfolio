      'During my junior year of college, I first learned about Java programming language in an Information Systems and Operations Management (ISOM) course, which sparked my interest in coding. As I explored various online resources to further my skills, I stumbled upon Javascript and began my journey as a developer.',

      'Initially, I relied on online courses and tutorials to learn coding, but I found the information to be too scattered. Seeking a more structured approach, I enrolled in a comprehensive web development course on Udemy. This course ignited my passion for coding and motivated me to explore other technologies, such as NodeJS, ReactJS, and more, through additional courses.',

      "When the Covid-19 pandemic first hit, my family's restaurant faced staffing challenges as employees were leaving. To help out, I stepped in and took on additional responsibilities. Despite the initial challenges, the pandemic caused a slowdown in business, which provided me with an opportunity to pursue my passion for coding. I used the free time in the afternoons and after work to work on coding projects and hone my skills.",

    content:
      "As part of my responsibilities, I was tasked with developing a mobile application for my family's restaurant. Overseeing the entire process, from designing to coding and launching on App Store and Google Play Store, helped me gain valuable knowledge on troubleshooting and problem-solving. During this project, I relied heavily on Stack Overflow to search for answers, locate bugs, and solidify my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Although the mobile app generated some traffic, it was clear that a web app would make it more accessible to users searching on Google. To address this, I spent a few months building my first full-stack web application using React for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend. ",

      'While the mobile application I developed for the restaurant attracted decent traffic, a web app was necessary to improve accessibility through Google searches. I spent several months building my first full-stack web app using React and NodeJS. However, customer feedback highlighted that the initial version had messy, hard-to-maintain code. I replaced it with Taipei Cuisine V1, which used Typescript for cleaner, more maintainable code. Although version one worked well, I continued refining the user interface and features in a new version. Unfortunately, my parents sold the restaurant in July. Still, I managed to update the basic features for both the mobile and web apps, which now serve as demos showcasing my coding skills.',

    content:
      "While I had created a personal portfolio site before by following a tutorial, I wasn't satisfied with how it represented my skills. So, I decided to put in some extra effort to update and improve it. For the new version, I chose to use NextJS and Tailwind. Tailwind was a great choice because it allowed me to code faster and more efficiently, while also giving me the chance to learn and experiment with the framework. With these tools at my disposal, I was able to create a much more polished and effective portfolio site that truly showcases my abilities.",
